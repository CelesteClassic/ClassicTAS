# Installation
If you are using Windows or Mac, download the corresponding zip, then unzip it.
If you are on Windows, you will extract an executable and some .dll files into a folder, then you can run the executable.
If you are on Mac, you will find a .app file inside the zip which you can execute.

If you are on Linux, wait some time until I export it for Linux.

# Usage
First of all, you will see a timer in the top-left corner, which tracks the time, and a black rectangle right next to it, the black rectangle is an input viewer, where you can see what keys are being pressed on that frame. The input viewer will be blacked out because you can inout anything yet, as you are in the spawning state, once the spawning state is over (at 00:01.16) you will be able to see the keys.
Each time you press a key (up, down, right, left, x, c, or z) that key will toggle on/off for that frame.
To step forward in time press L, which will advance the game one frame, and the keys that were inputted for that frame will be executed.
To step backwards in time press K, which will step 1 frame backwards, and you can change what was pressed before.
To see the TAS in real time press P, which will start reproducing the inputs from the frame you are currently on.
To see the TAS in real time from the start press Ctrl+P, which will reproduce the inputs from the start.
To save the TAS press M, which will automatically create a file called 'adelie.tas' in the love2d folder (Elaborate on this).
To open a TAS file, simply drag the file into the window, note that this won't change the current state of the game, so you should always go back to the start after loading a TAS file.
